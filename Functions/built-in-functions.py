"""
This file contains some examples for built-in functions in python
they are functions that do certain things 
I will explain 
"""


#example 1 = .upper()
#added by @basmalakamal
str1 = "hello world"
print str1.upper()
#this how we use it and it is used to return the string with capital letters

#example 2 = isupper()
#added by @basmalakamal
str2 = "I love coding"
print str2.isupper()
#this function returns a boolean it is used to see if all letters in the string are capital I have only one capital letter here 
#so it returned False
#lets try again here
str3 = "PYTHON IS AWESOME"
print str3.isupper() #prints True

#example 3 = lower()
#added by @basmalakamal
str4 = "BASMALAH"
print str4.lower()
#it returns the string with small letters

#example 4 = islower()
#added by @basmalakamal
str5 = "Python"
print str5.islower()
#this function returns a boolean it is used to see if all letters in the string are small I have one capital letter here 
#so it returned False
#lets try again here
str6 = "python"
print str6.islower() #prints True

#example 5  = float()
#added by @basmalakamal
print float('12\n')
#we can use this one to input an integer and it will return a float depends on what you have written 
#for example I wrote 12\n (\n means a space) so it returned 12.0


#example 6 = id()
#added by @basmalakamal
print id(str6)
#it returns the identity of any object cause every object has an identity in python memory

#example 7 = len()
#added by @basmalakamal

str7 = "Programming"
print len(str7)
#you can use this function to return the length of any string (the number of characters), Plank spaces and symbols are also characters in python

=======






#example 8 = int()
#added by @basmalakamal

float1 = 7.0
print int(float1)
#it converts the variable into an integer 
#so the output will be only 7
=======




#example 9 = str()
#added by @basmalakamal

number1 = 7383929
print str(number1)
#it converts the variable into a string 
=======





#example 10 = max()
#added by @basmalakamal

list1 = [5,6,7]
print max(list1)
#it returns the biggest value in a list so here the output will be 7



#example 11 = replace()
#added by @basmalakamal
list2 = ["a","b","d"]
a = list2.replace("d","c")
print a
#it will replace the string d with the string c so the value if a will be [a,b,c]



#example 12 = append()
#added by @basmalakamal
list3 = [1,2,3]
print list3.append(4)
#it will append bumber 4 to the list so it will be [1,2,3,4]

#example 13 = index()
#added by @basmalakamal
list4 = ["a","b","c"]
print list4.index("c")
#it will return the index of the string c which will be 2

#example 14 = split()
#added by @basmalakamal
str8 = "Python"
a = str8.split()
print a
#it will create a list that has every character of the string as an item of it 
#outputs ["P","y","t","h","o","n"]

#example 15 = join()
#added by @basmalakamal
list5 = ["P","y","t","h","o","n"]
b =  list5.join()
print b
#it is the opposite of the split function it will join all items together into a string
#outputs Python




#example 11 = sort()
#added by @basmalakamal


#example 12 = replace()
#added by @basmalakamal


#example 13 = append()
#added by @basmalakamal

#example 14 = index()
#added by @basmalakamal

#example 15 = split()

#example 16 = join()
